# Manan Bhatia's First CS193 Homework

## Favorite things about CS193: 

- iclicker quizzes(I feel like they're kinda cool and help in revision!)
- really just excited bout the subject as a whole.
- Intro to Unix/Linux and terminal commands
- Can't think of anythng else right now but just gonna put this as the fourth bullet to demonstrate that I know how to use     them.
